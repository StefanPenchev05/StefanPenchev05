👋 Hi there! I'm Stefan Penchev, a passionate 17-year-old programmer with a love for creating in C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C#. 🚀
 
 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Physics and Music.

👨‍💻 When I'm not crafting elegant code, you'll often find me strumming my guitar, weaving melodies that harmonize with my coding journey. 🎸

📚 I'm also an avid reader, constantly exploring new worlds and expanding my knowledge through the pages of books. 📖

🌟 Join me on this exciting adventure as we embrace the limitless possibilities of technology, one line of code at a time! ✨
